### Steps that i used to Build this Project:

* Firstly, Created a DynamoDB table to store the items.
* Then Build a Lambda function to handle the CRUD operations on the DynamoDB table.
* Used S3 to store and host the web application's static files (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript).
* Created a CloudFront(Amazon Service) distribution to serve the S3-hosted static files with low latency.

## Tech Stack

**Frontend:** Html, Css, Javascript

**Languages:** Python

**Cloud Service:** Amazon S3, AWS Lambda, Route53, AWS DynamoDB, and AWS CloudFront Distribution

### Lessons Learned:

This project is a working serverless web application hosted on AWS.
I had a hands-on experience building a serverless application using AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, CloudFront. \
Additionally, I have gained experience working with AWS services and integrating them to build a complete solution.

This project helped me improve my skills in cloud computing, serverless architecture, and AWS services.
